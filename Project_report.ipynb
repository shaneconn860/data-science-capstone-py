    "For this project, we have been tasked with coming up with the best possible location for a company's first Cafe and Coffee Shop. The business owners have very ambitious plans for growth in the coming years as a result of their business acumen and experience in different hospitality ventures over the years. They have tasked us with coming up with an ideal location to open their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have identified the area of South Dublin to open their first location, for two main reasons. The first reason is that Dublin City Centre is so densely populated with coffee shops, cafes and restaurants that it is too competitive to flourish in such a competitive market, especially with a new and unknown brand. It should noted that the business owners are open to locations immediately outside the city on the South side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason is that South Dublin is considered a very wealthy and affluent area. It is the assumption of the business owners that if they can provide a leading service and quality of product, that the inhabitants of the South side of the River Liffey will spend more money and keep coming back. They hope that this location will be the first of many; once they develop the brand here, they can then branch out in to the city centre with a better-known brand and quality of coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further to the South of the city being an ideal area to start this business, it is on the coastal area of the South where the quality of life is higher. This area also boasts the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) Railway network leading in to the city and so the owners would ideally like to open a location close to one of these stations, hoping to attract early-morning commuters as well as catering for a lunchtime crowd. In order to identify the primary location for the first outlet, we need to take in to account the amount of competitor outlets that are already operating there, while also exploring if there are many shops and other services in the area. We will achieve this by utilizing the FourSquare API to return such locations."

    "Now that we have performed our main analysis, we can start to deduce what the best locations for the business will be. Based on the maps and tables above, we will split the areas in to three sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Stations with lack of Services**\n",
    "\n",
    "Right off the bat we can omit certain areas from our area of interest. We included the three most furthest stations but they are too far away AND have very little other services around them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Killiney\n",
    "- Shankhill\n",
    "- Bray\n",
    "- Glenageary\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their relative distance to the centre of Dublin, the folllowing stations have no meaningful services around them so it would not be wise to place a coffee shop/cafe here. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booterstown\n",
    "- Seapoint\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Stations with tough competition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The areas of two stations which would provide fierce competition are **Blackrock** and **Dun Laoghaire**. Despite these being built-up areas with many services, they both have a high number of cafes/coffee shops (Blackrock - 6, Dun Laoghaire - 12) and these 2 types of business are their top 2 most common venues. Further towards the city, Pearse St and Grand Canal Dock also have tough competition and due to their proximity to the city centre, they would not satisfy the criteria of being a truly South Dublin brand, as set out in the Introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Areas to consider**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following areas are ideal for consideration due to a the average frequency of occurrence of cafe/coffee shops and also the number of these types of businesses. We've broken them down by these results and we will discuss them in further detail in the Discussion section.\n",

    "Based on the results above, let's discuss these locations in further detail. The locations can in fact be split again based on location to city centre from looking at the map. First up is **Lansdowne Road** and **Sandymount**. The latter has just the one coffee shop to the former's four. **Lansdowne Road** station does boast a Foot and Nail Spa business close by whereas there are no other businesses near the Sandymount station.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next area to consider is **Sydney Parade**. There is just one cafe here already and the area is quite close to Sandymount Promenade which offers and ideal getaway for a stroll and takeaway coffee during the Spring and Autumn months.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Venturing deeper South now past Blackrock, we have **Salthill & Monkstown**, **Sandycove & Glasthule** and **Dalkey**. These three areas represent the true suburbs of South Dublin in our context here. **Salthill & Monkstown** has just the one cafe in proximity to the station, while **Sandycove & Glasthule** has two coffee shops and three cafes in its proximity. From exploring the map further, however, three of the five combined businesses are on the main Glasthule Road on the way to the station, which represents high competition for such a suburban area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final area to explore is **Dalkey**. **Dalkey** is considered the most affluent area in South Dublin, home to many celebrities and wealthy business people. It has two cafes and one coffee shop off the main street, Castle Street, leading to the station. It is the furthest south of our selected locations but could prove a hit with locals if this is to be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we have **Lansdowne Road**, **Sandymount** and **Sydney Parade** on the side closest to the city centre. We would recommend either **Sandymount** or **Sydney Parade** from this area as there is currently only one other cafe operating in each location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the more suburban areas, we have **Salthill & Monkstown**, **Sandycove & Glasthule** and **Dalkey**. **Salthill & Monkstown** would be the recommendation based on the current amount of competing businesses in proximity. However, given the allure and status of **Dalkey**, this may play a role in selecting this as the location, despite a higher amount of competition here."

    "The purpose of this project was to utilize location data using the FourSquare API to then provide a number of recommendations to open the first location of a new business venture. The primary stakeholders are the business owners themselves, who are looking to open up a cafe/coffee shop in South Dublin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our role as data scientists was to analyze the data that we tidied from inspecting the Foursquare location data and Dublin DART stations data. From this we had to provide clear and presentable findings to the business owners, using a variety of techniques from explorartory to data analysis to machine learning. We were able to rule out areas based on the criteria set out by the stakeholders and furthermore were able to identify the locations that were suited to their business objective. We took the results and dissected them further in the discussion section, where the owners can take upon themselves to make a final decision on where to open the first location of this new business venture."
